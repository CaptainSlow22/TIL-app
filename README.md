# Today I Learned

This is a full-stack web application that allows users to post an interesting fact that they learned and want to share with others. The app also has a voting system that shows how many users found a fact to be interesting, mindblowing or rather misleading. All the facts are stored in a Supabase database and they are fetched to the frontend using an API </br>
